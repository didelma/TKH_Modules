The Problem: Sexual Harassment and Discrimination in the Work Place

Sexual harassment is a pervasive epidemic that affects many women and other vulnerable groups. According to the “task force study harassment workplace”, in the US “25% to 85% of women report having experienced sexual harassment in the workplace”. Even though men also experience sexual harassment in the workplace, women are a lot more likely to be sexually harassed in the workplace and men are the majority of perpetrators. 

Within the US, the most vulnerable populations are immigrants and low-income single mothers who have no choice but to remain with their employers in spite of the harassment. One of the factors behind this epidemic is the power dynamics between the victim and abuser, sex also plays a big factor as well as the immigration status of the victim.

What I want to do is to design an app that will a safe space for them to share their experiences and how they can advocate for themselves. We want to give them a space where they can vent in a no-judgment-free zone.



The Solution: Community App

- This app can be downloaded for free on Android and the Apple store

- It will be mostly community-centered where women can anonymously post the issue(s) they are currently experiencing at their workplace and receive feedback from others

- This online community will have a no-judgment zone

- This will be an intersectional community from different social classes, races, LGBTQ, Nonbinary, and different walks of life

- This online space will not be only used as a conversation tool, our aim is to also be a solution centered community where we can help stop harassment at their workplace

- Our solution approach will be based on posts from our experts, and further counseling on how to proceed with charges 

- Another feature will be a section where users can honestly and anonymously rate their workplace

- In addition to counseling, we will collaborate with other career advancement programs and post their services

- Finance revenue will be accepted in the form of donations, sponsorships, and premium memberships for personalized help from our experts. We will also have free or low-cost services for lower-income users

- Funds will be used to provide a wage to the people that help keep this app running, PR, legal services, fundraiser, etc
